  "diagnosis": "\n    Low weekend occupancy for a boutique eco-lodge in Nilo, Cundinamarca (Colombia). \n    Current occupancy rate: 42% (target: 70%). \n    Average daily rate: $210 (competitors: $240). \n    Main issues: Limited digital visibility for nature experiences, weak Bogotá–Nilo getaway positioning, underutilized eco-tourism keywords.\n    Goal: Increase occupancy to 70% and ADR to $230 by attracting nature-focused travelers from Bogotá through targeted Google Ads campaigns.\n    ",
  "result": "Based on the provided campaign setup and goals, here are my initial data-driven optimization recommendations:\n\n1. **Review campaign performance metrics and KPIs**:\n\t* Analyze daily, weekly, and monthly ROAS, CTR, conversion rates, and CPC.\n\t* Identify underperforming ad groups, keywords, and campaigns to optimize.\n2. **Identify underperforming keywords and ad groups**:\n\t* Based on the provided keyword research, I recommend starting with the most high-value transactional keywords (e.g., \"Book a luxury weekend getaway\") in Ad Group 1: Luxury Accommodations.\n\t* Monitor performance and adjust targeting parameters to optimize ROAS and CTR.\n3. **Analyze click-through rates and conversion data**:\n\t* Review ad copy, landing page, and call-to-action elements for each campaign.\n\t* Test and refine ad copy variations to improve CTR and conversion rates.\n4. **Optimize bidding strategies and budget allocation**:\n\t* With a Target ROAS bidding strategy set at 400%, I recommend regularly reviewing performance data to adjust bids and ensure maximum return on investment.\n\t* Allocate budget across campaigns, ad groups, and keywords based on performance and ROI.\n5. **Adjust targeting parameters based on performance**:\n\t* Based on campaign performance, refine geographic targeting to include surrounding areas or nearby cities with high demand for luxury accommodations.\n\t* Adjust demographic targeting to better align with the target audience's interests and behaviors.\n\nTo further optimize campaigns, I recommend implementing A/B testing for ad copy variations, exploring remarketing strategies, and continuously monitoring quality scores and ad relevance.\n\nNext steps would involve:\n\n1. Implementing a data-driven approach to optimize bids, budget allocation, and targeting parameters.\n2. Conducting regular performance analysis and campaign optimization based on insights from Google Ads metrics and KPIs.\n3. Refining ad copy variations through A/B testing and refining landing page elements for improved CTR and conversion rates.\n\nPlease let me know how I can proceed with the next steps!",
